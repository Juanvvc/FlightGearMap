This is an Atlas-like application for Flightgear.
This application does not run on its own: you need FlightGear running in your
system.

= Installation =

Connect your Android device to the local Wifi network and run the
application. A dialog should appear with the IP of your device.

In your PC, copy the archive andatlas.xml to the directory FG_ROOT/Protocol

Run FlightGear with this option:

--generic=socket,out,5,the-ip-of-your-android-device,5501,udp,andatlas

where the-ip-of-your-android-device is the IP shown by your Android device.

If you find any problem, close the android application and run again.
Usually, you do not need to restart FlightGear.

I'll be available as "ludomotico" at the forums of FlightGear, www.flightgear.org/forums,
section Support->Atlas.

Enjoy.
